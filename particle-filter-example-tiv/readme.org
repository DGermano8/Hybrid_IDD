* Model

** Differential equations

Here are the differential equations used by the ODE model:

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = -\beta T V,
\]

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta T V - \gamma I,
\]

and

\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = p I - c V,
\]

** Stoichiometric

Here are the reactant and products as needed by the hybrid model and
the flows as needed by the CTMC model.

* Simulation/inference example

The =run-inference-from-simulation.py= script runs a program which
simulates a data set and then uses an ODE model (with a particle
filter) to estimate the parameters that where used.

** TODO Estimate rate parameters in terms of their logarithm

* Inference example

** TODO Include the state plots in =run-inf-cli.py=

** TODO Use the JSF for the simulation

* Environment

The [[file:./requirements.txt][requirements.txt]] file contains a description of the packages (and
versions) needed to run this.

** Setting up the environment

Use the following to set up a virtual environment.

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src
