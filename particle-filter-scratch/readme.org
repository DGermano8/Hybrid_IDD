#+title: Birth-death example using =pypfilt=

Run the =runner.py= script to generate the figures below using both
vectorised numpy code and a loopy version that is less efficient but
makes it easier to integrate external simulators.

The [[file:./requirements.txt][requirements.txt]] file contains a description of the packages (and
versions) needed to run this.
