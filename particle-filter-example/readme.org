* Simulations

Run the =run-simulations.py= script to generate the figures below
using both vectorised numpy code and a loopy version that is less
efficient but makes it easier to integrate external simulators.
Simulations from the hybrid process are shown in [[fig:hybrid-non-vec][this figure]].

* Inference example

Run the =run-inference.py= script to simulate some data from the CTMC
and then attempt to estimate the parameters for the process using the
hybrid model. The estimation of the birth rate as additional
information is used is shown in Figure [[fig:inf-birth-rate]].

There are two classes implementing inference with the hybrid model.
The first, which generated the plot above, assumes that we can sample
exactly from the times at which the events occur. The second, which we
refer to as the /clocked/ implementation uses the formulation of the
process as a sequence of IVPs with random event times. The resulting
posterior estimates for the birth rate with this model are shown in
Figure [[fig:inf-birth-rate-clocked]].
